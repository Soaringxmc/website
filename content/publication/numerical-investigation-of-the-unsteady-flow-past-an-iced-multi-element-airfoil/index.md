abstract: Unsteady flow characteristics are investigated using wall-modeled
  large-eddy simulation for a 30P30N threeelement airfoil with streamwise ice
  and horn ice accreted at its slat leading edge, respectively. The ice
  accretions cause massive flow separation above the slat, which results in a
  surface pressure plateau on the slat and further unloads the downstream wing
  elements. The above mentioned two ice shapes lead to lift decreases of 10.66
  and 16.45% and drag increases of 44.58 and 59.42%, respectively. Ice-induced
  vortices first roll up due to Kelvinâ€“ Helmholtz instability above the slat
  with ice accretions, and the subsequent vortex pairing halves their
  characteristic motion frequency. The developed vortices, composed of
  multiscale structures, dominate the slat upper surface and are convected
  through the main element to aggravate the flow separation over the flap.
  Moreover, extremely strong acoustic resonance occurs in the iced slat cove,
  and its tonal frequencies are consistent with theoretical model predictions.
  These intense tones are believed to result from the elevated pressure
  fluctuations along the cavity free shear layer, which are in turn related to
  the propagation of the ice-induced pressure fluctuations from above the slat
  because their most dominant frequencies identified by proper orthogonal
  decomposition are nearly equal to the resonant frequencies.
