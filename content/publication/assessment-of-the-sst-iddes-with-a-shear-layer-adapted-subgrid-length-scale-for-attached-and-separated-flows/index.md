abstract: A shear-layer-adapted subgrid length scale is applied to the improved
  delayed detached eddy simulation using the shear stress transport background
  model (SSTIDDES). The aim is to assess the combination of the wall-modeled LES
  (WMLES) branch of the SST-IDDES with the new length scale in computing
  attached flows, as well as to assess the effect of the new length scale when
  it is applied to the SST-IDDES for mitigating the “grey area” issue through
  initiating a dramatic drop of eddy viscosity in the initial region of a free
  shear layer. The assessment is conducted through simulations of a turbulent
  boundary layer, a fully developed channel flow, a near-sonic turbulent jet and
  a backward-facing step flow. The results provide strong evidence for the
  conclusion that the SST-IDDES combined with the new length scale performs the
  same as the original SST-IDDES when its WMLES branch is applied to compute the
  resolved parts of an attached flow, and the combination helps mitigate the
  “grey area” issue of the SST-IDDES and accurately represent the K-H
  instability in the initial region of a free shear layer. In addition, the
  superiority is particularly remarkable for the simulations with coarse grids.
