abstract: Separated flowfields around two iced airfoils with horn features near
  stall are numerically studied using wall-modeled large-eddy simulation. The
  iced airfoils are the GLC305 airfoil with rime ice 212 and the NLF0414 airfoil
  with glaze ice 623. A grid-quality-based hybrid central/upwind scheme is
  applied for numerical flux computation. The close agreement between the
  computed lift, drag, and surface pressure distribution and the experimental
  results illustrates the capability ofthe present method. In particular, the
  current method can accurately predict the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability of a
  free shear layer. The statistical results, instantaneous flowfields, pressure
  fluctuations, and characteristic frequencies are investigated. Both flowfields
  are dominated by separation bubbles. The bubble length increases with the
  angle of attack according to a quadratic relation. A strong-fluctuation region
  in the flowfield grows rapidly at high angles ofattack, especially near stall.
  High- and low-frequency peaks are found in the initial and further downstream
  regions ofthe free shear layer, respectively. The high frequency is caused by
  the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability andvortex shedding.Thelow frequency mightbe
  causedby the vortex merging in the further downstream region of the free shear
  layer.
