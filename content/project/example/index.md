High-fidelity simulations are conducted to accrurately predict the aerodynamics around iced wings and to reveal the dominant flow mechnisms in iced wing flows.

* Aerodynamic effects of horn, streamwise and ridge ice on (multi-element) airfoils via wall-modeled LES and AMD-IDDES
* Extracted the dominant flow structures via proportional orthogonal decomposition (POD)
* Analyzed the vortex motions in the ice-induced separated shear layers and acoustic resonance around the iced slat
* Studied the aerodynamic effects of horn and streamwise ice on wings via AMD-IDDES
* Analyzed the effects of wing tip vortex and end-wall interactions
